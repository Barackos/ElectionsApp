-----
During semester break of 2018, I was honored to be asked by a political party to create this mobile application.
Its goal was to deliver real-time voting status of 38k residents of our town, straight from the voting booths.

This was a solo project of mine.
However, I was working closely with the campaigners in order to characterize their needs & get feedback during development.
